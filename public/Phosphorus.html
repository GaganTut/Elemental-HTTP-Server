  <h1>Phosphorus</h1>
  <h2>P</h2>
  <h3>Atomic number 15</h3>
  <p>Phosphorus is commonly misspelled %22phosphorous%22. It is an essential component of living systems and is found in nervous tissue%2C bones and cell protoplasm. Phosphorus exists in several allotropic forms including white (or yellow)%2C red%2C and black (or violet). White phosphorus has two modifications. Ordinary phosphorus is a waxy white solid. When pure%2C it is colourless and transparent. It is insoluble in water%2C but soluble in carbon disulphide. It catches fire spontaneously in air%2C burning to P4O10%2C often misnamed as phosphorus pentoxide. When exposed to sunlight%2C or when heated in its own vapour to 250%C2%B0C%2C it is converted to the red variety. This form does not ignite spontaneously and it is a little less dangerous than white phosphorus. The red modification is fairly stable and sublimes with a vapour pressure of 1 atmosphere at 417%C2%B0C.</p>
