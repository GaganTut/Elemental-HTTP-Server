  <h3>Atomic number 8</h3>
  <p>Oxygen is a Group 16 element. While about one fifth of the atmosphere is oxygen gas%2C the atmosphere of Mars contains only about 0.15%25 oxygen. Oxygen is the third most abundant element found in the sun%2C and it plays a part in the carbon-nitrogen cycle%2C one process responsible for stellar energy production. Oxygen in excited states is responsible for the bright red and yellow-green colours of the aurora. About two thirds of the human body%2C and nine tenths of water%2C is oxygen. The gas is colourless%2C odourless%2C and tasteless. Liquid and solid oxygen are pale blue (see picture above) and strongly paramagnetic (contains unpaired electrons).</p>
